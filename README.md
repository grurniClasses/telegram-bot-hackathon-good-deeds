### About this bot:

During the "Iron Swords" war, people looked for a way to ask for help and to find those who could help them. Our telegram bot connects between those who want to volunteer and people who have help requests by location.

 
#### Technologies: 
- Python 3.11
- Poetry
- MONGODB

##### Future Features:
- Add more precise location options.
- Translate the bot into other languages such as English, Arabic, and Russian.
- Add an option to close a help request which was opened by the user and is no longer relevant.
- Add animations like throwing confetti to those who volunteered.
